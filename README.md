# Firebase Authentication Error Handling Improvement

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase Authentication: unhelpful error messages when authentication fails. The `firebaseAuthBug.js` file shows how a generic error message makes debugging challenging. The solution, `firebaseAuthSolution.js`, provides a more robust approach to handle various error codes for improved debugging and user experience.

## Problem
The Firebase Authentication SDK sometimes provides vague error messages, such as `auth/invalid-email`, which doesn't clearly indicate the root cause (incorrect format, disabled account, or wrong password). This makes it hard to give users precise feedback.

## Solution
The improved code handles various error codes specifically, providing more detailed error messages to both the developer and user.  This approach helps in identifying the exact authentication problem and delivering more informative feedback.
